Opening Opposition attacks a comparative without ever really exploring what it is. They can't win this debate by proving that there has been growth in the last 35 years and that some of that has to go down. They have to examine what would happen otherwise and prove that that is better. Given that they've given a generic case for why lending should occur to people that require loans and are willing and capable of paying them back
we wanna hear from them what regulation they would enable because the logical extension
if everything they've said is that they would have no regulation whatsoever. They can't get away with saying
"Lending is good
 and winning a debate about deregulation thereby pausing lending. Three things in this speech. Firstly
exploring a little further the alternatives to the financial industry that would have sprung up in answer the Opposition's cry about what would have been the alternative without ever really analyzing it. Secondly
why we get better growth and thirdly
why crises are happening
more important than growth
proven by text and crucially
un-responded by the leader of the Opposition. Firstly
alternatives to the financial industry. It's a little unconventional to start with some second speaker substantive
but the way
the reason why I'm doing this is gonna become clear. Let's look at the context of 1980s and realize that Opposition's kind of mysti
mystery what would have happened otherwise
isn't gonna take them the debate here. What was the context? A lot of the developing countries they were talking about today
that today are most of the financial hubs of New York
of Hong Kong
of Frankfurt
were in a period of economic transition. They were moving away from industries like coal or steel. In the case of Hong Kong
they were rapidly developing
moving away from things like shipping to post-industrial things moving toward services. The question then is not the fact that financial growth did happen and cause growth
it is what would the alternative transition have looked like? In Opening Government
we say it would have looked like things like services
like health care
like technology. Why was that likely to be the case? Two things. One
we were in a
a situation of massive economic prosperity in a lot of these cases. Instead of putting the money
the euros
the dollars and the cents in the halls of Goldman Sachs
we would see them going to other industries. As people were getting more and more money and more likely to be investing it anyway
we think them putting into things like their education as opposed to in things like loans
putting it into other industries would have been preferable. The second thing is
we were seeing huge increases in education at the time. There were very smart people
very high rated edu
university attendance growing these countries. We would have preferred those people do things that at the moment
a lot of smart people still do but not as many
work
rather than saying the best and brightest go to Wall Street. Those are things like becoming health care. The Opposition member has a job at a hedge fund in Connecticut. I think they're incredibly smart and I suspect they're gonna use that to make an argument for authority later. But the thing to say about that is we'd rather Kate be doing something far more interesting and far more productive than moving money about corporates of the richest.  Why this better? Firstly
as we said in Tex's speech
a lot of the subsidiary products Opposition has to defend are just not productive. They wanted to take the easy case which was loans
but things like options on those loans
are for instance
not paying wages of the people whose jobs are lost. Secondly
they ignore Tex's end point which was that often
the political ramifications of this were long-term. When people did not understand why they were losing their jobs
they could not see any benefit in the way that
like in tech you can at least look at an iPhone and think it's pretty fucking cool. You do not understand why your money is being lost
why your home loan is collapsing because of things happening on the other side of the country. The end point at this point
is that even if Opposition shows that the deregulated financial industry is more productive than the regulated financial industry
it doesn't win them this debate because they have to prove that it is better than the regulated financial industry plus where will those other people would have gone to work or
right
all that other money would have been invested. I think here
another thing they're likely to say
and notice here
we're OJ
we don't have much time
but the language of Opening Opposition suggests that later on they're going to go and say that developing countries were somehow liberated by those loans. We give you in the 80s
the
an example
of countries that did not take this path of development. Countries like the Asian Tigers
who turned to
to manufacturing services and even today
in countries like Singapore
do not have like massively speculative financial markets. We'd say that is a preferable kinds of industries and those
those were better places for those countries to grow. Secondly
on growth. Opposition gives general reasons why economic growth and loans are good
you get more employment
you get more spending in local communities. The trickle down eventually works
not why deregulation resulted in growth. Tex gave you three kinds of products that deregulation created. Things like gambling on subsidiary products
things like bubbles on safe
things like
or things that are perceived to be safe
for instance
a housing bubble. And even the good ones they wanted
were made bad when they were bundled up in things that eventually collapsed
things like Fannie Mae
Fred like
like those
those huge subprime mortgage collateral groups. And
and the fact they only really dealt with the third and didn't consider our mechanisms at how that was polluted by the existence of the other products
speaks to their inability to respond to this debate. What did they say? Two things. One
they said you get twice as many loans when the lending and liquidity ratio changes. I think when you're lending less loans
you're gonna be sticking to the safe loans. As I'll prove later
that makes things less risky
but ignore the other two claims that we brought you. The second thing they said is that there's a mechanism of competition between financial products
between financial providers. We think that drives a race to the bottom in this debate. When you're competing to have people invest in your hedge fund
you wanna get the biggest rate of return right now in the next year
even if it means in ten
in
in three years time
that that loan collapses. The last thing they say here is that you get good loans on the poorest. That carries a huge third-party harm when there is a massive risk to the economy
that small
some people getting slightly more loans at the moment is not worth. But lastly
we think the regulation of financial services
like doesn't often have that option
like it would have happened anyway. When people who can't pay back loans want loans
and they don't have other ways to make money like investing in products that have no real value
they're likely to be doing the things they can do to make money and that was giving real products. Closing.The info slide is since the 80s.  If you really want to run that 1945 extension
go for it.  On crises
there were no responses to any of Tex's mechanisms about how contagion [INAUDIBLE [00:22:25]
about how the other products were bundled up. Two things to stay here. Firstly
why is slower growth with fewer crises better? Notice
I didn't even need to win anything. The Opposition rested their case on
because we proved this in Tex's speech. You get less fear and insecurity when people can more gradually get money. But secondly
there are problems with huge crises for that growth later
hysteresis effects. We think people being steadily employed at lower wages is better than having long-term and structural unemployment when entire industries collapse overnight. And second
a new point of substantive under this point
is we think you get more [INAUDIBLE [00:22:57] deregulation. So
if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suddenly says they want some deregulation
though they haven't made that clear what the limit would be
we think we make
they make that regulation harder. Why's that? One
regulatory capture where you have large and politically important industries in the center of the city
when deregulation saw credit agencies being controlled
and secondly
when
as Opposition says
you can only associate that growth with deregulation
news frame mark
arguments instead of looking at real prosperity and real people's lives on the ground
you're politically unable to have any alternatives. So
proud to stand in Opening Government.
