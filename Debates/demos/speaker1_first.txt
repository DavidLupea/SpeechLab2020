For those of you who know her
Amy Williamson and I
we run the social media wing of Oxstrap
[Phonetic] which is one of the journals that does macroeconomic policy in Oxford. And one of the things we do is tweet articles on a regular basis. Check it out. But one of the things we've both noticed is that there is a stunning macroeconomic consensus among people who claim we have simply not learned the lessons of the times of the Great Depression
and that the era we now live in
is repeating those mistakes and has done so to the detriment of literally
millions of families around the world. So
the alternative we stand for is a return to the post Great Depression realization that we do need things like the separation of investments
wings of banks and savings wings
things like the Glass-Steagall Act
things like the limitations on product
the types of products that the financial sector can use
things like the burden of proof being placed on the new instrument to prove its validity and safety than on regulators who are often undermanned and stretched to prove that these things are not dangerous. The return to a time of transparency of ownership and to a time of greater regulation overall. Gonna do a few things. First
I'll explain quickly the effects of this massive regulation in the past as a retrospective debate. Second of all
I'll tell you why the spectrum of loans created on net were harmful. Number three
I'll do the trade-offs for you in this debate and why economically we should not have taken that deal and last of all
a quick suggestion on why mass deregulation that is harmful feeds itself. No
thank you.
